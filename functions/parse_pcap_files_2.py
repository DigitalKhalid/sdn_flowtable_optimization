'''
Convert PCAP file to CSV:
    - 1. Create a blank file with defined column names 
    - 2. Read and get each packet from the PCAP file
    - 3. Append each packet to the new row of created file using CSV library
    - 4. This process is good for very large PCAP file and consumes less memory. If there is a problem during this process, we have
            CSV file with all packet data that has been processed. We can even stop the process when we need.
